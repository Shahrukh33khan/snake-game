# Snake-game
This project implements the classic Snake game using Python and the Pygame library. The game involves controlling a snake that moves around the screen, consuming apples to grow longer. The objective is to achieve the highest score possible without colliding with the snake's own body or the walls of the game.

**Features**

Snake Movement: Control the snake's direction using arrow keys.
Apple Spawning: Apples spawn randomly on the screen for the snake to eat.
Score Tracking: The score increases when the snake eats an apple.
Game Over: The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the edges of the screen.

Python 3.x

Pygame library
